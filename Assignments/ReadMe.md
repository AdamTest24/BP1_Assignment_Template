# Assignments Folder:

This folder contains the following three items:

## Assignment:

This will be a .ipynb (Jupyter Notebook) file that you can see on the root level of this folder. This is your assignment template, which you must fill out and submit before the submission deadline. See [L2D Handbook](https://learntodiscover.github.io/L2D-Handbook/section7.html) for more instructions.

## Data Folder:

If the assignment requires the use of any datasets, you will find these data inside the [Data](./Data) folder.

## Feedback Folder:

Once you have submitted your assignment notebook, it will be marked by a L2D tutor, and returned to you with both a grade, and feedback, within 14 days of timely submission. Your grade will be given as a GitHub Pull Request, which will also contain a single overall feedback comment about your work. The notebook itself will contain tutor-initialled comments within your code cells, containing more specific commentary. If you receive a Pass or Distinction, you will automatically receive the model solutions in your [Feedback](/Assignments/Feedback) folder. See section [Assignment Marking](https://learntodiscover.github.io/L2D-Handbook/section8.html) for more information.
