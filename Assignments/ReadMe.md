This folder contains the following three items:

## :computer: Assignments:
This will be a .ipynb (Jupyter Notebook) file that you can see on the root level of this folder. This is your assignment template, which you must fill out and submit before the submission deadline. See L2D Handbook for more instructions.

## :file_folder: Data Folder:
If the assignment requires the use of any datasets, you will find these data inside the Data folder.

## :open_file_folder: Feedback Folder:
Once you have submitted your assignment notebook, it will be marked by a L2D tutor, and returned to you with both a grade, and feedback, within 14 days of timely submission. Your grade will be given as a GitHub Pull Request, which will also contain a single overall feedback comment about your work. The notebook itself will contain tutor-initialled comments within your code cells, containing more specific commentary. If you receive a Pass or Distinction, you will automatically receive the model solutions in your Feedback folder. See section Assignment Marking for more information.

### :pencil: Marking Criteria:

### :closed_book: Revise (<50%):
Assignment demonstrates a lack of understanding of at least some of the key concepts, and misses the point of what is expected of the assignment. Half, or more, of the assignment has been misunderstood, and requires revision in order for the candidate to fully understand the concepts of the module. Assignments that fall into this category may also be incomplete, with evidence of questions that have not been attempted.

### :star: Pass (50-80%):
Assignment demonstrates a solid grasp of the material, where the code written achieves the correct result for at least 50% of the questions. Assignments in this category are complete, with no questions left unattempted, and reflect a solid grasp of the core concepts of the material covered in the module.

### :trophy: Distinction (>80%):
Assignment demonstrates a fluent, complete understanding of at least 80% of the material, with code written as demonstrated across the moduleâ€™s learning materials. Where required, the candidate has also demonstrated evidence of a synthetic understanding of relevant concepts across the wider course material. Assignments in this category are complete, with no questions left unattempted, and reflect a fluent grasp of all the concepts explored in the material of this module, and beyond.
