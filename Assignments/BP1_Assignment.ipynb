    "1. Protein Kinases have a phosphorylation site and a consensus sequence has been determined for these sites (Rust and Thompson, 2012). All the proteins incorporate either a Serine or a Threonine residue that gets phosphorylated. Naturally, the consensus sequence for each protein varies slightly from that of other proteins. When studying a polypeptide in the lab, a colleague realised that it has a phosphorylated Serine. So they tried to sequence the polypeptide, and managed to obtain a sequence for the protein:\n",
