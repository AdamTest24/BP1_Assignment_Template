# Feedback Folder:

If you submitted your assignment on time, you will receive the following within 14 days of the submission deadline: 

1. A **GitHub Pull Request** indicating your grade, with overall feedback.
2. Your **marked assignment manuscript** returned as a Jupyter Notebook: the file extension will contain _MARKED in its name, and the Notebook itself will contain tutor-initialled commentary and feedback, inside.
3. A **model solutions** Notebook (this is only pushed back to your Feedback folder if you receive either a Pass or Distinction).

## Grade:

If you have received a Distinction or Pass, no further action required, on your part. 

However, if you have received a Revise, you will need to open the _MARKED notebook, and check the comments to see why you were awarded this mark. You will then be required to re-attempt this notebook, and re-submit a copy of it with _REVISED appended to the filename. Please follow the instructions on how to submit a revision in the [L2D Handbook]() within a week of receiving your grade, and we will re-mark this, and return it to you. If you subsequently achieve a Pass or Distinction, you will then also receive the model solutions.

*Note: To revise an assignment, you must closely follow the instructions for resubmission outlined in the L2D Handbook, or you risk your revision not being registered for re-marking.*

For any enquiries or questions, please make use of our [discussion forum](https://github.com/orgs/L2D-October2023/discussions), or [contact us by email.](mailto:admin@learntodiscover.ai)

With best wishes,

**The L2D Team**
